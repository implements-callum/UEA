Coursework from my BSc in Computer Science (with year in industry), below I overview the modules I did over the years. In year 3, I will be taking a year out to work in industry as part of my course and complete what would be year 3 in year 4 instead. I believe this will provide me with extra hard/soft skills and I will document this below when the year comes.
